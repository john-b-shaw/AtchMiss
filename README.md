# AtchMiss
Hydrodynamic model of the Mississippi-Atchafalaya diversion


TO RUN THE HYDRODYNAMIC MODEL AND PRODUCE THE RESULTS AND FIGURES FOUND IN THE MANUSCRIPT: Simply run AtchMiss_Outputs_revisions_v1.m. You will need the AtchMiss.mat dataset available here: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13645601.v1

TO ALTER a specific hydrodynamic model, you will need to update one of the netstruct* .mat files. 

TO work with historic, digitized USACE hydrograph data, use AtchMiss.mat, the data repository file, which must be downloaded separately from Figshare: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13645601.v1
